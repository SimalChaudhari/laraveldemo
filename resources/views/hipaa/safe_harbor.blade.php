				<p>"HIPAA Safe Harbor" for Medical Professionals using Best Practices:</p>

				<ul>
					<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Before January 5, 2021, fines, settlements and penalties for HIPAA non-compliance totaled over $40 million for the prior two years alone. On that date Congress passed a law introducing a "Safe Harbor" protecting HIPAA-covered practices and Business Associates from those financial penaltiesâ€”If they adopt so-called Best Practices, and if those Best Practices have been in place for the prior 12 months.</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Hipaamart provides easy-to-use procedures to comply with Best Practices objectives set forth in the HIPAA Safe Harbor Act with respect to Training and Risk Assessment.</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A cybersecurity information security specialist should also be retained locally to protect the medical provider's computer system from illegal hacks and ransomware attacks.</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A medical practice can be audited for HIPAA violations by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) of the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department.</li>
					<li>There is some flexibility in the Security Rule, depending on your practice's size.</li>
