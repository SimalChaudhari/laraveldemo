				<p>A medical provider has to train every employee in security awareness to protect the privacy of your patients' health records. That's mandatory. It's an administrative requirement of HIPAA's Privacy Rule (45 CFR §164.530b(i)) and Security Rule (45 CFR §164.308, 5(i)).</p>

				<p>And a medical provider is required to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the medical practice’s security safeguards that protect that privacy with a risk assessment process.</p>

				<p>HIPAA imposes those obligations.</p>

				<p>The Hipaamart Portal provides:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>A <strong>training</strong> video (to be viewed annually by each employee) that’s complete, memorable and easy to use. Current employees can watch it now. New employees watch it as soon as they start work. And all employees watch it again <strong>annually</strong> to stay up to date.</li>
					<li>A <strong>Risk Assessment tool to be used annually</strong>. Risk Assessment is the second critical element of HIPAA compliance. The medical practice has to designate an employee to be responsible for the overall security of the patients’ electronic health records (ePHI). HipaaMart provides a Risk Assessment Questionnaire for that employee to complete every year. This employee is known as the "HIPAA Compliance Officer".</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The HipaaMart Portal keeps a record of employee training for each employee and a copy of the annual Risk Assessment Questionnaire. The objective of both training and risk assessment is to assure that your practice reaches the <strong>Safe Harbor</strong> of Best Practices and is documented in the event of an OCR audit. A cybersecurity information technology specialist must also be engaged.</p>

				<h3><strong><u>HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule</u></strong></h3>

				<p>These rules carry out the intent of HIPAA to protect patient privacy and to ensure the security of electronic protected health information (called ePHI). The federal Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing these rules.</p>
				<p>Your practice must comply voluntarily or could face monetary penalties. Here is what your practice must do:</p>

				<ul>
					<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Make sure your patients’ ePHI is confidential but available;</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Protect it against security threats (hacking, for example)</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Protect it against impermissible use or disclosure (leaving it lying around publicly)</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Make sure your employees comply with HIPAA</li>
					<li>Make sure your Business Associates comply with HIPAA</li>
				</ul>

				<p>There is some flexibility in the Security Rule, depending on your practice's size.</p>
