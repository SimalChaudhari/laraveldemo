                <p>HIPAA requires that all employees with access to confidential HIPAA information receive training. Training should be given to new employees within a reasonable time of their hiring. Training should also be repeated for all employees annually. A record of each employeeâ€™s training activity should be preserved in the event of any audit by the Federal OCR regulators. For the training requirements, the following are provided:</p>

                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>Training Video</li>
                    
                    <li>Training Quiz</li>
                    <li>Training acknowledgement which can either be (i) signed on-line or (ii) printed and signed by each employee after completing the training video and quiz.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong><u>Note:</u></strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">If an employee is interrupted during the training quiz, the employee can return to where he or she left off.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The "Training Acknowledgement" can be signed on-line by the employee. This will document the training requirement in the event of an audit from the OCR.</li>
                    <li>If the employee prefers, the Training Acknowledgement can also be downloaded and printed from Document .03 in the Document Library and then can be signed in hard copy.</li>
                </ul>
